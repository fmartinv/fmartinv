<h3 align="left">Career Objetives:</h3>
<p align="left">
In this moment espending more time learning how to improve my job speed and quality, with AI tools, also learning a lot about CI pipelines and PLAYWRIGHT e2e testing, NODE js and GQL to have a global view of any web app.
</p>

<h5 align="left">Typescript</h5>
<p align="left">
Requirements in work journey of  development led me to explore TypeScript . Integrating it into my daily work has been instrumental in enhancing my code quality and developer experience. Initially, when I first started using TypeScript, it felt like learning a new language alongside JavaScript. However, through continuous practice and real-world application in my current role, I've gained a strong grasp of its benefits, including improved type safety, better code organization, and increased confidence in maintaining complex projects. This journey highlights the importance of embracing new technologies and continuously learning to elevate my development skills..
</p>

<h5 align="left">Javascript</h5>
<p align="left">
As a passionate frontend developer, I'm thrilled with the progress I've made in conquering JavaScript. fourth years ago, when I embarked on my serious development journey, JavaScript was like a foreign language. However, by immersing myself in hands-on projects, I've built a solid foundation in crucial areas like arrays (mastering methods like filter, map, slice, pop, and shift) and object creation using constructor functions. Now, I feel comfortable applying this acquired knowledge to bring my development ideas to life.
</p>

<h5 align="left">React</h5>
<p align="left">
From the first day learning react in my learning path, I immediately fell in love with this framework, I already realize how useful it is for team development, how easy and customizable it is.

I dream of being in more awesome projects in the future</p>
